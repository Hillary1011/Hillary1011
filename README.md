[Introduction]

I am an Information Communication enthusiast with a strong focus on computer networking and network operations. I have a solid foundation in CCNA-level networking concepts, configuring, troubleshooting, and simulating enterprise-style networks using Cisco technologies and network analysis tools.

My technical interests center on building reliable, secure, and scalable network infrastructures, with practical exposure to LAN/WAN design, routing and switching, IP addressing, VLANs, DHCP, VPNs, and network security fundamentals. In addition to networking, I actively use Python for network simulations, automation experiments, and performance analysis, and I am comfortable working with packet analysis and virtualization environments.

This GitHub repository serves as a practical portfolio showcasing my networking projects, configurations, and hands-on learning aligned with real-world NOC, network administration, and junior cloud support responsibilities.

## Objective
My journey in Information communication engineering has led me to develop a passion Computer networks andassociated technologies I am eager to actively participate in this field specifically aiming for junior-level opportunities in Network Operations (NOC), Network Administration, Junior Cloud Engineering, or IT Support (Level 2), where I can apply my CCNA-level networking knowledge, hands-on configuration experience, and troubleshooting skills in real operational environments.

My goal is to contribute to day-to-day network monitoring, incident response, configuration management, and infrastructure support while continuing to deepen my expertise in enterprise networking, cloud-integrated networks, and network automation.
